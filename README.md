# Data Structures implemented in c++

These folders contain headers and .cpp files of several data structures and algorithms that I implemented for class.

Others are welcome to look at my projects as a reference for implementing their own projects. Take my code with a grain of salt because it is definitely not perfect.

## File Structure

Each folder will contain a data structure/algorithm and the different implentations that I did for each one(linked lists, arrays, etc.)



Below is the list of every project along with some info for it's implementations.

* Queue - Incremental Array, Fixed Array, Doubling Array, Linked List, Doubly Linked List
* Vector - Incremental Array, Fixed Array, Doubling Array, Linked List, Doubly Linked List
* Stack - Linked List
* Tree - Link List and it uses recursion

## **Running it**

I have included a makefile in each folder so you can run these commands in the shell to run it.

```sh
$ make
$ ./main
```

You can also run a g++ command. There is no need to add any other files to the linker. There is only one .cpp file

```sh
 $ g++ -std=c++11 <filename>.cpp -o main  
 $ ./main  
```
