### Mergesort and quicksort

you can call the functions like this

```c++
mergesort(arrayname, 0, arrayname.size-1)
Qsort(arrayname, 0, arrayname.size-1)
```

### how to run it

I've included a makefile so we can easily compile it by typing make.

```sh
$ make
$ ./main
```

You can also compile it running g++
```sh
g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o main
./main
```
